            In Cham's Skyward Journey, the player controls a character named Cham with the goal of collecting stars. 
            Each time Cham collects a star, his color shifts to a different hue, adding a visual element of variety.
             Additionally, Cham's size increases by 10% for every five stars collected, symbolizing his journey 
             towards the sky. However, the game ends if Cham touches a bomb, adding a challenging element to the 
             gameplay. Players must balance star collection with careful navigation to avoid bombs and achieve the 
             highest score.
                                                                                                                     -->>
